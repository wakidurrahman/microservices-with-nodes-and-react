# Deployment and orchestration

Containerization provides an opportunity to move and scale applications to clouds and data centers.

Containers effectively guarantee that those applications run the same way anywhere, allowing us to quickly and easily take advantage of all these environments. 

Additionally, as we scale our applications up, we need some tooling to help 

- automate the maintenance of those applications, 
- enable the replacement of failed containers automatically, 
- and manage the roll-out of updates and reconfigurations of those containers during their lifecycle.

What is `orchestrators`?
Tools to `manage`, `scale`, and `maintain` containerized applications are called `orchestrators`.


**Two of the most popular orchestration tools are**

1. Kubernetes
2. Docker Swarm.

**Turn on Kubernetes**

Docker Desktop sets up Kubernetes for you quickly and easily. 

**Enable Docker Swarm**

Docker Desktop runs primarily on Docker Engine, which has everything you need to run a Swarm built in

Open a terminal, and initialize Docker Swarm mode:
