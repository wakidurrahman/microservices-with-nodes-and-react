# Section 1: Drive Into Docker!

> Why use Docker?

Answer: Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies.

> What is Docker?

Docker: is a platform or ecosystem around creating and running containers.

Image: An image is a single file containing all the dependencies and all the configuration required to run a very specific program.

Container: A container is an instance of an image runs a program. 


Docker client (Docker CLI): Tool that we are going to issue commands to 
Docker Server (Docker Daemon): Tool that is responsible for creating images, running containers, etc.

What is a container?

A container is a sandboxed process running on a host machine that is isolated from all other processes running on that host machine. That isolation leverages kernel namespaces and cgroups, features that have been in Linux for a long time. Docker makes these capabilities approachable and easy to use. To summarize, a container:

- Is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.
- Can be run on local machines, virtual machines, or deployed to the cloud.
- Is portable (and can be run on any OS).
- Is isolated from other containers and runs its own software, binaries, configurations, etc.

What is an image?

A running container uses an isolated filesystem. This isolated filesystem is provided by an image, and the image must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configurations, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configurations for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.


Namespacing and Control groups
These features of namespacing and control groups are specific to the Linux operating system. So namespacing control groups belong to Linux, not to Windows, not to macOS.


When you installed Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac you installed a Linux virtual machine. So, so long as Docker up here is running, you technically have a Linux virtual machine running on your computer.

Inside of this virtual machine is where all of these containers are going to be created.
So inside the virtual machine, we have a Linux kernel, and that Linux kernel is going to be hosting, running processes inside of containers.

And it's that Linux kernel that's going to be in charge of limiting access or kind of constraining access or isolating access to different hardware resources on your computer.
