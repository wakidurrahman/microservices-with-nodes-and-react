# First Course: Docker and Kubernetes The Complete Guideline (By Stephen Grider)

Build, test, and deploy Docker applications with Kubernetes while learning production-style development workflows

## Learn Topic

- Learn Docker from scratch, no previous experience required.
- Master the Docker CLI to inspect and debug running containers.
- Build a CI/CD pipeline from scratch with Github, Travis CI, and AWS.
- Understand the purpose and theory of Kubernetes by building a complex app.
- Automatically deploy your code when it is pushed to Github!

## Requirements

- A credit card is required to deploy projects to AWS or Google Cloud

## Description

- CI/CD Workflows?
- AWS Deployment?
- Kubernetes in Production?

This is the ultimate guide to learn how to deploy any web application you can possibly dream up.  Docker and Kubernetes are the newest tech in the Dev Ops world, and have dramatically changed the flow of creating and deploying web apps. Docker is a technology that allows applications to run in constructs called 'containers', while Kubernetes allows for many different 'containers' to run in coordination.

## Docker from Scratch!

In this guideline you'll learn Docker from absolute fundamentals, beginning by learning the answer to basic questions such as "What is a container?" and "How does a container work?".  From the very first few topic, we will do a deep dive on the inner workings of containers, so you get a core understanding of exactly how they are implemented.  Once you understand what a container is, you'll learn how to work with them using basic Docker CLI commands.  After that, we'll apply your new-found mastery of the Docker CLI to build your own custom images, effectively 'Dockerizing' your own personal applications.

## CI/CD Pipelines

Of course, no guideline on Docker would be complete without a full understanding of common Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment patterns.  You will learn how to implement a full CI + CD workflow using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, creating a pipeline that automatically deploys your code every time you push your latest changes to Github!

## Multi-Container Deployments on AWS!

After building a deployment pipeline, you'll apply it to master both single-container and multi-container deployments on Amazon Web Services.  You will construct a multi-container application utilizing Node, React, Redis, and Postgres, and see the amazing power of containers in action (Note: all Javascript coding in this guideline is optional, the full source code is provided if you don't want to write JS).



## Kubernetes!

Finally, you will tackle Kubernetes, a production-grade system for managing complex applications with many different running containers.  You will learn the right way to build a Kubernetes Cluster - this course doesn't have any of those annoying "don't do this in production" comments!  You will first build a Kubernetes Cluster on your local machine, then eventually move it over to a cloud provider.  You'll even learn how to set up HTTPS on Kubernetes, which is harder than it sounds!



## Here's what you'll do:

- Build your own custom images tailored to your applications.
- Master the Docker CLI to inspect and debug running containers.
- Understand how Docker works behind the scenes, and what a container is?
- Build a `CI + CD` pipeline from scratch with `Github`, `Travis CI`, and `AWS`
- `Automatically deploy` your code when it is pushed to `Github`!
- Build a `complex multi-container application` from scratch and deploy it to `AWS`
- Understand the purpose and `theory of Kubernetes`
- Deploy a `production-ready Kubernetes` Cluster to Google Cloud

## Who this course is for: Software engineers looking to deploy their apps easily and quickly

# Second Course: Microservices with Nodejs, Express.JS, MongoDB and React.JS and Next.JS

Microservices: A microservices architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services. It provides the framework to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices architecture diagrams and services independently.

## Content of the project.

1. SSH
2. Performance
3. Testing
4. TypeScript
5. SPA and SSR(Server Side Rendering)
6. Security
7. Code Analysis
8. Sessions + JWT
9. Cache
10. Redis
11. CI/CD
12. Docker
13. AWS

## Using technology.

- Front-End
  - ReactJS
  - NextJS
- Each Service is Created by: 
    - Nodejs
    - Express.js
- Data for each service 
    - Mongo
    - Redis
- The entire app is deployed and Runs
    - Docker containers
    - Executed in a Kubernetes cluster.
- And all of the code is written with.
   - Typescript.

## Partial list of what I'll do here.

- Practice `patterns to create scalable microservices` for a variety of app domains
- Write a custom implementation of an `event bus`.
- Build a `Server-Side-Rendered React` app using `Hooks` and `Next JS`
- Optionally, run a `development environment through a cloud provider`.
- `Consistently structured responses` from your different `API's`.
- `Best practices` in communication between different `services`.
- Configure and scale your services using `Kubernetes Deployments`.
- Document and enforce `structure constraints` on events shared across microservices
- Limit access to your APIs using `JWT-based authentication`
