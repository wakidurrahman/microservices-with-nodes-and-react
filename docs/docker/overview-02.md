# [Get started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

## Part 1: Overview of the get started guide

- **What is a container?** A container is a sandboxed process running on a host machine that is isolated from all other processes running on that host machine.

- **What is an image?** A running container uses an isolated filesystem. This isolated filesystem is provided by an image, and the image must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configurations, scripts, binaries, etc.

## Part 2: Containerize an application

**Prerequisites**

- Docker Desktop.
- Git client. (git/github)
- Visual Studio Code.

Get the app

```
├── getting-started-docker-app/
│ ├── package.json
│ ├── README.md
│ ├── spec/
│ ├── src/
│ └── yarn.lock
```
Build the app's image

> In the `getting-started-docker-app` directory, the same location as the `package.json` file, create a file named `Dockerfile`. You can use the following commands to create a `Dockerfile` based on your operating system.

```
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
EXPOSE 3000
```
---
` docker build -t getting-started-docker-app . `

> - `-t` (flag tags your image)

> - `.` (The `.` at the end of the docker build command tells Docker that it should look for the Dockerfile in the current directory)


---

`$  docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 getting-started-docker-app `

> - `-d` : The `-d` flag (short for --detach) runs the container in the background.

> - `-p` :  The `-p` flag (short for --publish) creates a port mapping between the host and the container. 
    The -p flag takes a string value in the format of `HOST:CONTAINER`, where `HOST` is the address on the host, and `CONTAINER` is the port on the container. 
    The command publishes the container's port 3000 to `127.0.0.1:3000` (`localhost:3000`) on the host. Without the port mapping, you wouldn't be able to access the application from the host.
