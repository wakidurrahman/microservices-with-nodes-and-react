# Section 6: Creating a Production-Grade Workflow.

We've learned quite a bit about 

 - `Docker containers`, 
 - `Docker images`, 
 - `Docker CLI`, 
 - `Docker Compose`.


But we still don't know a lot about how to actually use Docker in a production type environment. 
In other words, how do we actually develop an application that uses Docker, and then eventually push it to some outside hosting service like AWS or DigitalOcean?
