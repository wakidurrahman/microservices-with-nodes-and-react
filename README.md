# Microservices with Nodejs, Express.JS, MongoDB and React.JS and Next.JS

Microservices: A microservices architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services. It provides the framework to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices architecture diagrams and services independently.

## Content of the project.

1. SSH
2. Performance
3. Testing
4. TypeScript
5. SPA and SSR(Server Side Rendering)
6. Security
7. Code Analysis
8. Sessions + JWT
9. Cache
10. Redis
11. CI/CD
12. Docker
13. AWS

## Using technology.

- Front-End
  - ReactJS
  - NextJS
- Each Service is Created by: 
    - Nodejs
    - Express.js
- Data for each service 
    - Mongo
    - Redis
- The entire app is deployed and Runs
    - Docker containers
    - Executed in a Kubernetes cluster.
- And all of the code is written with.
   - Typescript.

## Partial list of what I'll do here.

- Practice `patterns to create scalable microservices` for a variety of app domains
- Write a custom implementation of an `event bus`.
- Build a `Server-Side-Rendered React` app using `Hooks` and `Next JS`
- Optionally, run a `development environment through a cloud provider`.
- `Consistently structured responses` from your different `API's`.
- `Best practices` in communication between different `services`.
- Configure and scale your services using `Kubernetes Deployments`.
- Document and enforce `structure constraints` on events shared across microservices
- Limit access to your APIs using `JWT-based authentication`
