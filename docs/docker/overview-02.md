## Part 1: Overview of the get started guide

- **What is a container?** A container is a sandboxed process running on a host machine that is isolated from all other processes running on that host machine.

- **What is an image?** A running container uses an isolated filesystem. This isolated filesystem is provided by an image, and the image must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configurations, scripts, binaries, etc.

## Part 2: Containerize an application

**Prerequisites**

- Docker Desktop.
