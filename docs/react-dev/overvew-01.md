# [Describing the UI]( https://react.dev/learn/describing-the-ui)

React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces (UI). UI is built from small units like buttons, text, and images. React lets you combine them into reusable, nestable components.

### Your first component

React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components. A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup. Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

=> Components are one of the core concepts of React. They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI), which makes them the perfect place to start your React journey!

Recap
You’ve just gotten your first taste of React! Let’s recap some key points.

React lets you create components, reusable UI elements for your app.

In a React app, every piece of UI is a component.

React components are regular JavaScript functions except:

Their names always begin with a capital letter.
They return JSX markup.


### Importing and Exporting Components

The magic of components lies in their reusability: you can create components that are composed of other components. But as you nest more and more components, it often makes sense to start splitting them into different files. This lets you keep your files easy to scan and reuse components in more places.
